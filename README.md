# Freddy and Mia
*Project F&M*, *F&M*, or *Freddy and Mia* is an adventure game about cats going on an adventure to defeat a dragon.
The game is *planned* to release mid-2025, but you're allowed to compile the source and suggest changes.
When the game is released, you'll find it on the ***releases*** page and ***HOPEFULLY*** you'll be able to download it on Steam.
