# Freddy and Mia (Project F&M)
*Project F&M*, *F&M*, or *Freddy and Mia* is an adventure game about cats going on an adventure to defeat a dragon.
The game is *planned* to release mid-2025, but you're allowed to compile the source and suggest changes.
When the game is released, you'll find it on the **releases** page and ***HOPEFULLY*** you'll be able to download it on Steam.
# How to compile
Use MSYS2 and go to the directory where the project is located. Usually *C:/users/<user_name>Freddy_Mia_Game*. then use the command `g++ start.o brandlogo.o -o fm -lgif`. then run it by using `./fm`. If it doesn't run, that's because I'm really bad at coding.
